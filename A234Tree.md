# (2, 4) Tree

**What is a (2,4) Tree?** <br />
A 2-3-4 Tree is a multiway search tree. It’s a self-balancing tree; it’s always perfectly balanced with every leaf node at equal distance from the root node. <br />
Other than the leaf node, every node can be one of three types:<br />
* 2-Node has two child nodes and one data element. <br />
* 3-Node has three child nodes and two data elements. <br />
* 4-Node has four child nodes and three data elements. <br />

**Insert the numbers 3, 7, 5, 15, 17, 9, 13, 21, 11, 19 into a (2, 4) tree.** <br />
